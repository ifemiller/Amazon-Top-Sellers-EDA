# Amazon-Top-Sellers-EDA

Utilizing this kaggle dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/sootersaalu/amazon-top-50-bestselling-books-2009-2019 to perform some basic EDA using Pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.

The data is in great shape so data cleaning was mininmum.

Currently: Still working on the EDA. 

Next:I'd like to also try creating a recommender system based on User Ratings and number of Reviews.
Tutorial I would follow for reference: https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/recommender-systems-python
